## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Purpose

The purpose of the assignment is to create an employee directory with React. This assignment requires you to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

The user (employee or manager) should be able to:
1. View non-sensitive data about other employees
2. Have the ability to filter employees by name.

## Technologies Used

1. Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/
2. React JS - https://reactjs.org/
